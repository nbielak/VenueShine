  "Americana duo Gutter Swan emerged onto the San Francisco music scene in 2015, featuring the powerful, emotive vocals of Loryn Barbeau, and the disarming yet complex guitar of Steve Egelman. Steve and Loryn bonded over a love of music, whiskey and punctuality, and thus Gutter Swan was born.",
  "Folk Singer/Songwriter, Jessica Malone, and Americana storyteller, Nick Foster, have come together to form Wild Town. Jessica sings with the spirit of Mt. Shasta and Nick's voice has roots as deep as a Norther Oak. Locked in harmonies begging to be heard, their voices weave intricate stories about home, being on the road, getting lost in the desert and some old boots falling in love.",
  "Dillbilly (pronouns: they/them) is a genre-queer alt-country singer-songwriter based out of Oakland, CA. Raised in a trailer park in the rural midwest near the Ohio River, Dill grew up surrounded by cornfields and grain silos going jug fishing and playing classical piano. Born to a touring singer/guitarist father, Dill was introduced to the music world at a young age. At 18, they won a piano scholarship that sent them to Berklee College of Music. Feeling uprooted and homesick as a transplant in Boston, Dillbilly dropped out and went back to the Midwest to start a band with their high school friends. Over the past 20 years, they have been performing and touring across the U.S. and Canada releasing 9 full length albums as well as contributions to soundtracks for movies and TV under their birth name, Denise Dill. Most of those releases were self recorded and released. Since moving to the Bay Area in 2015, they renamed their musical self and chose a name that more accurately embodies where they come from, where they draw inspiration, who they collaborate with, and how they identify as a genderqueer person. Now, in the 2018, they are performing as a band and have teamed up with renowned musician and producer Julie Wolf to create their 10th full length record which will be released next year.",
  "Sometimes the seas of life are choppy. Luckily, it's always blue skies and smooth seas at Yacht Rock Thursdays. From 5-6pm EVERY THURSDAY we WILL play nothing but the smoothest Yacht Rock radio in the bar. And remember, when your friend is drowning in a sea of sadness you don't just throw them a life preserver. You swim one over to them. Let's set sail...",
  "Max Chanowitz is bringing classy back. An experienced jazz pianist out of Oakland, Max has tickled the ivories for over 15 years. He began with classical training but was seduced by the improvisatory freedom of jazz after taking lessons at the Berkeley Jazzschool. Aside from leading local jazz/funk trio The Jazztronauts, Max plays with various jazz groups around the Bay as well as performing solo. Pairs well with evening gowns and the sound of clinking cocktails.",
